Soenen Hole Counting and Positioning System
Overview
The Soenen Hole Counting and Positioning System is an advanced industrial solution tailored for precision quality control. This system excels in the accurate detection, counting, and positioning of holes in metal frames, leveraging cutting-edge technologies in computer vision, machine learning, and industrial automation. Designed for modern industrial environments, this system ensures meticulous quality assurance and integrates seamlessly with existing automation infrastructure.

Key Features
Hole Detection and Counting:

Utilizes the OpenCV library to process images captured by industrial cameras.
Applies Gaussian blur and edge detection techniques to enhance image clarity and highlight hole contours.
Measures hole diameters and positions with high precision, converting pixel dimensions to millimeters based on a calibration factor.
Filters detected contours to ensure only valid holes are counted, improving accuracy in quality control.
Image Stitching:

Employs OpenCVâ€™s stitching algorithms to merge multiple images into a single panoramic view.
Provides a comprehensive view of the frame, 
allowing for better analysis of holes over larger areas and ensuring thorough inspection of the entire surface.
PLC Integration:

Connects to Siemens PLCs using the snap7 library, enabling re
al-time monitoring and control.
Facilitates automated quality control by reading from and writing to the PLC, integrating the system with existing industrial automation setups.
Real-Time Data Management:

Processes image data in real-time, with a dashboard updating current statistics and status.
Saves hole detection results, stitched images, and other relevant data to files, providing accessible and detailed records for analysis and reporting.
Multithreading:

Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to handle concurrent image loading and preprocessing.
Enhances system performance and efficiency, particularly when managing large volumes of image data.
